## Generative AI Enhanced by RAG Solution & Multilingual Documents

This repository showcases the use of the open-source Mistral model, **Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GPTQ**, as a generative AI tool. The focus is on the Moroccan economy, using a selection of documents including:
- The **World Bank Report 2023**
- Two reports from the **High Commission for Planning**

These documents are provided in three languages:
- English
- French
- Arabic

### Multilingual Context and Embedding Model
Given the multilingual nature of this project, I will utilize an appropriate embedding model for such contexts: **xlm-roberta-base**. This model is well-suited for handling content in multiple languages.

### Objective
The aim is to test the generative AI model both before and after enriching it with document information. This will demonstrate the effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in improving the performance of generative language models. Specifically, we will explore how incorporating private data in certain contexts or sectors can enhance the model's ability to generate more customized and relevant responses.

### Approach

The approach used in this project primarily relies on open-source models. However, it can be applied with either open-source or paid generative models, as well as with open-source or paid embedding models. The choice depends on:
- The specific application
- Project budget
- Sensitivity and privacy concerns related to the data
